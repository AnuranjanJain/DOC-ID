## Project Story

This **ID Card Generator** was created for the DawnOfCode hackathon, hosted by the MERN Club at VIT Bhopal. As a member of the Tech Team, I single-handedly developed this website using HTML, CSS, animations, and a matrix effect to provide participants with instant ID card generation. The site has been widely appreciated by many participants for its design and functionality.
